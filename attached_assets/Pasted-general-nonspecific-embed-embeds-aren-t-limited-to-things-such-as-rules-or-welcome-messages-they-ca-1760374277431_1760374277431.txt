general/nonspecific embed
embeds aren't limited to things such as rules or welcome messages, they can be used for anything! 
✎ step one
create the embed by using /embed create name:general_embed
you can name the embed anything you'd like, however we strongly recommend naming it something simple and easy to remember.
✎ step two
let's start to edit the embed to our liking! 
remember : you can either outright use these edit commands, or use the buttons + modals from creating your embed to have an interactive text form.
you can edit any part of the embed to whatever you'd like! you can customize it to whatever you'd like to fit your server. this guide just goes through creating a common general embed.
editing the author: /embed edit author embed:general_embed text:{server_name} icon:{server_icon}
want something else for the author? just replace {server_name} & {server_icon} with whatever text/ image you'd like.
note: if you'd like an image in your author, its link must be in the icon: section of the command  
editing the title: /embed edit title embed:general_embed title:learn about our server!
is this embed for something else? just replace learn about our server with whatever text you'd like c:
editing the description: /embed edit description embed:general_embed description:let's get comfy at {server_name} c:

> owned by: {server_owner}

> created on: {server_createdate}
is this embed for something else? just replace all the text after general_embed with whatever description text you desire.
Discord on PC/Desktop/select devices do not allow new lines in slash commands. If you're looking to have new lines/better spacing in your embed, we recommend either going through the text modal OR using the {newline} variable in place of where you want a new line to start.
